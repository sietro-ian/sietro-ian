I'm aÂ _Web_ **Developer**Â withÂ **Graphic Design**Â expertise. I enjoy building cutting-edge user interfaces backed by progressive modular paradigms. I mainly focus on _SPA (PWA)_ development for the modern web platform. My go-to programming language isÂ **Javascript**Â withÂ [**VueJS**](https://vuejs.org/) framework.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SDK libraries for [Appmixer](https://www.appmixer.com/) embedded iPaaS and workflow automation system.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [NuxtJS](https://www.appmixer.com/) to compensate the lacking SPA-SEO for e-commerce with SSR/SSG.
